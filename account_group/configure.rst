To configure account groups, you need to:

#. Be "Account / Adviser" role.
#. Go to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Accounts Groups*.
#. Create or modify existing groups.

For assigning groups to account templates, you have to:

#. Set the group on your account chart module or extension.
#. Or develop/create UI access.

When you have groups on your account templates, you can load a chart template
for a new company, and they will be transferred to created accounts.
