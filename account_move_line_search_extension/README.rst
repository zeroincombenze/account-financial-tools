Journal Items Search Extension
==============================

This module adds the 'Journal Items Search All' menu entry.

This menu entry adds a number of search fields on top of the List View rows.
These fields can be used in combination with the Search window.

The purpose of this view is to offer a fast drill down capability
when searching through large number of accounting entries.

The drill down is facilitated further by opening the Form View when clicking on
the sought-after entry.
This allows an intuitive click-through to the related accounting documents
such as the originating Bank Statement, Invoice, Asset, ...
